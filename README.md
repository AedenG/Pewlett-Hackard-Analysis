# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
Pewlett-Hackard requested that I look into the number of employees who will likely retire soon. This will affect how many vacant positions there will be in the near future and they would like to make a plan for this. Specifically, they have asked me to determine the number of employees per title that will be reaching retirement age. They also asked me to identify the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Data
- Data Source: retirement_titles.csv, unique_titles.csv, retiring_title.csv, mentorship_eligibility.csv

## Results

### Number of Retiring Employees by Title
- 90,399 employees will reach the age of retirement soon. Some have had multiple positions during their time employed by Pewlett-Hackard.

- Many employees, who will soon reach retirement age, currently occupy senior positions. These positions will need to be filled upon their retirement.

## Summary 

Knowing the salary of the outgoing cohort will be helpful in planning the budget for promoted or newly hired employees.

The department of the retiring employee will be helpful to be aware of when considering staffing needs.
